# Picky
A fast and easy to use online tool to design scheduled PRM/SRM assays. The Picky tool (i) automatically generates optimized and scheduled SRM/PRM assays for proteins of interest and (ii) provides means to validate the data via known fragmentation spectra of corresponding synthetic peptides (based on ProteomeTools 10.1038/nature13319).
